I did not get the whole app working. 
A few issues: any commands given run the whole program. I did not figure out how to split it up. So if you enter spotify-this-song "song"
it will run the whole program including the movies and tweets. THis will happen with any of the commands but it will return the right
song and movie.

I also couldn't figure out how to put the spotify keys in the .env file so i hard coded it. I did figure it out for twitter keys though.



UPDATE:7/11/18 I figured out how to get it all working. Please disregard my notes above.
